type="tAlloGen"

type="tFieldWorks"
></object
> (aka <object
type="tFLEx"
></object
>). <object
type="tAlloGen"
></object
> allows you to define operations on <object

></object

type="tStemAllos"
></object

type="tCitationForm"
></object

><object
type="tAlloGen"

type="tFLExVersion"

type="tFLEx"
></object
> and is only available on 64-bit Windows computers.</p
><p
>Each operation defined in <object
type="tAlloGen"
></object

type="tCitationForm"

Simply check the “Regular expression” check box or leave it unchecked.  When you edit any replace here, the changes made will also be made in the corresponding replace in the <object
type="tEditReplaceTab"
></object
